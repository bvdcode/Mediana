The entropy corpus was encoded and independently decoded with AOM v3.13.1
[`entenc.c`](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/refs/tags/v3.13.1/aom_dsp/entenc.c)
and [`entdec.c`](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/refs/tags/v3.13.1/aom_dsp/entdec.c).
CDF adaptation uses that release's `update_cdf`. These native routines are used
only to produce the fixture; the tests and library are fully managed.

`entropy.bin.gz` contains 600 cases, each with 96 mixed arithmetic symbols,
equiprobable booleans and literals of zero through 32 bits. Alphabets range from
2 through 16 symbols; each has uniform, peaked, rising and end-peaked initial
probabilities, enabled/disabled adaptation, and initial counters 0, 15, 16, 31
and 32. Every operation records its decoded value, arithmetic range, arithmetic
value, bit consumption and updated ascending CDF, including its counter.

The first eight uncompressed bytes are `AV1ENT01`, followed by a little-endian
32-bit case count. A case stores four bytes (alphabet size, probability shape,
adaptation flag, initial counter), 32-bit operation and encoded-byte counts,
16-bit ascending CDF entries including the counter, and the encoded bytes.
Each operation stores operation kind and literal width as bytes, decoded value
as uint32, range and arithmetic value as uint16, consumed bits as uint32, and
the resulting CDF as uint16 entries. Gzip uses a zero modification timestamp.

The normative algorithms are AV1 1.0.0 with Errata 1, sections 8.2.2–8.2.6:
[approved specification](https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-spec/av1-spec.pdf).
This corpus verifies entropy primitives; it does not establish AV1 picture or
video decoding coverage.

`flat.obu` and `palette.obu` are 16×16, 8-bit monochrome lossless AV1
reduced still pictures encoded by libaom 3.8.2. Their `.gray` files were decoded
independently by libdav1d 1.4.1. The patterns are neutral gray and a repeating
four-color grid. Encoding uses lossless mode, 16×16 fixed partitions, disabled
CDEF/restoration/filter-intra/intra-edge/angle-delta/smooth/Paeth/intrabc, and
zero quantization. The tests require exact pixel equality and complete entropy
termination; this does not establish inter-frame or color AV1 coverage.
